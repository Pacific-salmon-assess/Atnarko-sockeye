All raw age data as extracted from Atnarko sockeye xlsx spreadsheet Age tab. data within this folder includes:

- Total age of sockeye (1-6years) in each source category split into a csv:
	- `spawners_age` 
	- `marine_harvest_age`
	- `Bella_Coola_R_FSC_age`

- ages of sockeye for the run (combined escapement and FSC data only):
	- `stock_structure`


metadata for: 
`spawners_age` 
- Missing lots of years of more recent data 
- Recommendations for group to consider:
	- adding a spawning site where possible (multiple rows for multiple years, or columns for each site with no new rows)


`marine_harvest_age`
- Commercial catch only. Sub-area and catch location noted where possible. Assumptions all catch is from Area 8.
- Current format could use improvements as they are in wide format.
- Recommendations for group to consider:
	- restructure data to long format. Add catch location and date where possible.
	- verify dates and locations where possible on PADs data. 
	- get PADs data entered (may already be done via Kate's MSc) and get data into NuSEDs


`Bella_Coola_R_FSC_age`
- Catch composition from Nuxalk in-river fishery on the Bella Coola River. 
- uncertainties include unclear if this it ALL catch composition for upper and lower catch, or just Lower Bella Coola River catch. 

`stock_structure`
- ages of sockeye for the run (combined escapement and FSC data only). Data sources unclear and not up to date. Proportion of ocean-type and 1 freshwater year given.

General concerns and comments:
	- lots of missing data. Could use NuSEDs and PADS summaries to populate, as well as records via Kate M's MSc (FSC only **) 
	- FW ages are only accounted for in combined escapement and FSC data.  
	- Does not allow user to assess caveats with data (e.g., spread of sampling dates across the season/ differences in sampling effort across spawning or fishing locations)
	- To separate marine FSC or combine with commercial when/where possible? If updating with current information available may find vague sources.
