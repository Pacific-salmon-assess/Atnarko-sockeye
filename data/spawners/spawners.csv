1976,30000,,30000,,Escapement Records; Last year of entry in Atnarko Sockeye Binder and BC16 Historic.  The observations in both were Oct 6-8 and numbers don't show more than 5K.  Missing data from mid to late September inspection that probably supports 30k annual estimate.,

Assumed from the notes that the Sept 30 inspection was expanded for the final estimate (as says final escp't 25-30k) beside that inspection.  From Sept 30 Stillwater to Lonesome est. 2,000 and above Lonesome 20,750.  Used these to determine ocean vs. lake types in 30k annual estimate.",

Confusing expansion due to sections inspected: 12- Rainbow to Stillwater (7,500), 27- Tenas to Stillwater (12,000), and 2- Knot to Elbow and Tenas to Lonesome (11,200). From the latter, the only section not inspected was between Elbow and Rainbow Lakes.  It appears as though the 20K annual estimate was subjective, based on all of the counts.  To break down the 20K estimate into lake vs. ocean type, used the highest count from each section: Knot to Elbow- 1,200; Rainbow to Tenas- 600; Head of Tenas- 500; Tenas to Lonesome- 10,000; Lonesome to Stillwater- 2,000.
