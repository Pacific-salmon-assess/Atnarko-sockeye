All raw age data as extracted from Atnarko sockeye xlsx spreadsheet Age tab. Types of age data include:
- `spawners_age` 
- `marine_harvest_age`
- `Bella_Coola_R_FSC_age`

Each major type is split into a csv. 


metadata for: 
`spawners_age` 
- all age information for spawners as in spreadsheet. Currently very limited. 
- Recommendations for group to consider:
	- adding partitioning by spawning site where possible (multiple rows for multiple years, or columns for each site with no new rows)


`marine_harvest_age`
- Commercial catch only. Sub-area and catch location noted where possible. Assumptions all catch is from Area 8.


`Bella_Coola_R_FSC_age`
- Catch composition from Nuxalk in-river fishery on the Bella Coola River. 
- unclear if this it ALL catch composition for upper and lower catch, or just Lower Bella Coola River catch. 

General concerns and comments:
	- lots of missing data. Could use Nuseds and PADS summaries to populate, as well as records via Kate M's MSc (FSC only **) 
	- FW ages are not accounted for in current data format. 
	- Does not allow user to assess caveats with data (e.g. no sampling dates listed)
	- to separate marine FSC or combine with commercial? If updating with current information available may find vague sources.
