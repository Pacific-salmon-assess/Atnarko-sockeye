Currently only individual assignment probabilities for 2003 samples.  



Group considerations:
- do we see if genotypes are still available for 2003 data? Microsatellite data should not be used on an individual basis like this. More appropriate to use catch sample proportions with partitioned uncertainty (considers bias and sample size- see Anderson et al 2008)
- add in 2004 (BC et al 2019) and FSC (McGivney thesis 2024)? In what format: unrealistic to expect all accessors to run GSI with genotypes.
