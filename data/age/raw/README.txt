This folder contains a dump of all available data (as of Feb 2026) in DFO databases. Compiled by Ivy Strother.

“Atnarko Sockeye Ages – available data”: summarizies available data. The sheet “Data Source Overview” should walk you through the databases and the filters used. The second sheet is a comparison between the downloaded data. I’ve also included a pivot for each data source showing a summary of # samples/age, year, project etc… The last sheet references the bio-data. As discussed, we’ll kick that down the road for now.

- If I’m correct, you’ll only need to use the “Age Batch Detail Jan 2026” and “Age Readings Data Feb 2026” to reconstruct age composition over time. I’ve included PADS in case anyone has background knowledge on the difference/intended exclusions.
